Java Quick Revise
1. Whats present inside jdk, practically and theorytically?
2. Is java an interpreted language? No Java is not interpreted language. The recompilation of jvm byte code to jit machin code is considered as interpretation. WHile java involves compilation. 
3. Copy constructor
4. Can we have static class? We cannot have top level classes as static while nested classes can be static. 
5. Can we use super keyword in main method? No. We cannot. Check its use.
6. Be careful about initializer block and constructor invocation order. It is static initializer of parent, static initializer of child, instance initializer of parent, construtor of parent, instance initializer of child, constructor of child. 
7. How interface involves loose coupling in java? Interface just not only allow a class to implement its method but it allows multiple classed to implement its method. Now, when we interact with the class using the interface then we can feed any class implementing the class without much modification. 
8. Object Cloning. Deep Cloning and shallow cloning. Explain using: https://dzone.com/articles/currying-functions-in-scala-1
9. Unboxing. we do it like int a = b.intValue();
10. String are immutabe. String are inert concept. 
11. Immutable Class
12. Check the working example of string tokenizer. 
13. Check all note point of Exception handling in java, Correct in note point 6 that after catch block runs the code outside the try block will execute. Also, add one more not point "If we write return only in eighter try or catch block then we will get error. We need to write one at the last as well."
14. Thead lifecycle, note points of how to create a thread and other too. 
15. What is the difference in wait and sleep or waiting or sleeping? Wait method is object class method and invoked on an object for synchronization while sleep method is of thread class and invoked on thread for intentionally sleeping the threads work for certain duration. Check Join() method of thread as well. 
16. Order in sets: This is an eye opener. Let me just brief on the normal behavior of Sets. HashSet maintains no order, LinkedHashSet maintains order of insertion so while iterating it will print the values in the order of insertion and Treeset maintain ascending order which means the elements will be printed in increasing order. Also, hashset and linkedhashset can contain one null value while treeset cannot contain any null value. 
17. Update in the internal working of HashMap: First the hashvalue of key is find out through hashfunction method. Then, hashvalue is devided by 16. Whatever remainder comes would be the index and that will be the bucket. That's why multiple entries many have same bucket. Eeach bucket is a list in itself. When we try to get a map entry then again the hashcode of key is findout followed by division with 16 which will provide the index. There are changes that the bucket will have multiple entries thus we compare the key of each entry with the key provided as the argument of get method. 
18. Treemap cannot have any null key while can have one null value and it maintains the ascending order. WRT null values, hashtable works the same as treemap. Hashtable do support enumerator as well and is synchronized.
19. Check example of comparable and comparator interfaces. 
20. How do we do transaction management through normal JDBC? We have to create transaction management and need to use methods like rollBack(), commit() and save(). Generally, rollback() is written in catch block. 
21. Signature of variables and methods in interface. 
22. How to create a singleton class. CHeck carefully.
23. Check all programs related to ArrayList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap and TreeMap. 
Add implementation index 1 to downcasting in java study.
24. Call the child data members in parent class through downcasting. 
25. Coding example to show inheritance, polymorphism, Abstraction and Encapsulation.

27. Static and dynamic binding in java
28. Deep CLoning and SHALLOW cloning.
29. Heap and Stack. How instance and static types gets the value. 
30. Java Inner classes revision: Heirarchy, Advantage of inner classes, Describe the basics of each type.
31. Understand the core advantage of multithreading(4){simultaneous, same memory, fast cotext switching, one thread does not interrupt flow of other}, Life cycle of thread, 
32. All note points of Multithreading and synchronization Section. 
33. Garbage collection: exact use of finalize(), How can we request GC?
34. What all we can do with runtime class. 
35. Interruption of the thread, Reenterant lock in java and benefits. 
36. Default capacity of arraylist. How will you create your own arraylist. Arraylist based questions.
37. Check sorting the of all collection type: List{Integer, ObjectType}, Set{Integer, ObjectType} and Map{Integer, ObjectType}. Map{Integer, ObjectType}. Using Conparable and Comparator in case of object type. 
a) List with Integer: simple Sort method
b) List with Object type: either comparable on Object class, Comparator as annonymous class or can have multiple comparator. 
c) Set with Interger or Object type: Since, set does not maintain order we cannot ganuntee the sorting permanently. WHile if we need it just once then we can convert it into Arraylist and sort it like we sort a normal arraylist. 
d) HashMap with Integer and Interger: SetView to arraylist to Comparator. Can compare on the basis of key or value. 
e) HashMap with Object Type:

5a. Hibernate Study File
Updates:
1. The difference between load and get method. These methods are there to returnt the persisted (saved in database) object of a given id. However, when we call load the it does not return the real object but return thw proxy for th real object however get gets use the real persisted object. Also, load return objectNotFoundException if object not found while get gives null if object not found. 
2. The difference between persist and save method. Both are there to add an object in the database. Firstly, both works the same with persistent object but the difference comes in case of transient (which is not yet saved in db) object. Persist does not execute an insert statement outside the boudary of transaction while save method does that. Persist object not necessary that immediately persist the transient object while save will to it immediately. Other differnce between persist and save is that persist is JPA specifixation method while save is the hibernate specifjc method. Persist returns rull while save returns the primary key of the inserted rexord. By the way, hibernate js an implementation of JPA.

Hiebernate Quick Revise
1. Spring ORM implementation using Hibernate ORM.
2. Hibernate basic implementation for simple j2EE app. Check the client Specially.
3. Different hibernate methods.
a. difference in persist and save method(). First, persist method do not garuntee to assign value to transient object the value immediately, that may be assigned during flush time. Alsoo, it does not gaurntee to do insert outside the transaction boundry. Save can perform insert outside the transaction object. Another difference i recollect is that if we use incremental generator where primary id is given by hibernate then save return the primary key assigned while persist does not. 
b. The difference between load and get method. These methods are there to returnt the persisted (saved in database) object of a given id. However, when we call load the it does not return the real object but return the proxy for th real object however get gets you the real persisted object. Also, load return objectNotFoundException if object not found while get gives null if object not found. 
c. SaveOrUpdate(): This method will save the data if the data is not present in the table already, while update it if its present. Wwe can use this method outside the transaction boundry. 
d. update(): method used only to update the existing resource. 
4. Hibernate hirerarchy or inheritance mapping.

3. Action Tag: Used to control the flow of the jsp page and to use the bean. 
4. Expression Element
5. JSTL and Custom tags

Important updates:
1. Write detail functioning of HashMap.
2. write below note in Set section:
This is an eye opener. Let me just brief on the normal behavior of Sets. HashSet maintains no order, LinkedHashSet maintains order of insertion so while iterating it will print the values in the order of insertion and Treeset maintain ascending order which means the elements will be printed in increasing order.

ServletStudy file
Difference between web server, web container and application server with examples. 
Web server: Web server is a server capable of handling HTTP request and send back HTTP response. Web server performs different functons like transalating DNS name to IP address, load balancing is also taken care in case of pool servers or server farms. Examples are Apache HTTP server, 
Web container or Servlet container: It a container that contains java servlets, JSP and other component and manages them. When i say manage them, then i mean by their co 0mplete life cycle. Example is Apache tomcat.  
Application servers: Application server contains web server so can priovide all the feature of a web server and in addition to these features it can provide applicatio level services like exposing business logics, connection pooling, transaction support, messaging service. etc. Weblogic, Glassfish are some examples of application servers. 

Make a note in Servlet Attribute section:
"As we already know that servlet attribute has scopes like session, context or request. So, to create an attribute we have to use the object of the desired scope. Example: for request  attribute request.setAttribute("Id", 101);. Likewise for context and config we will create their objects."

JSP Action Elements
As the names hints, these are some element created in JSP for some special tasks. Let's have a look at them one by one. 
1. forward action element: It is used to forward the request and response to another resource. We know about it through servlet. 
<jsp:forward page="anotherpage.jsp">
2. include action element: It is the way to implement include fucntion as we ahve in servlet through tags. 
<jsp:include page="anotherpage.jsp"> 
3. useBean action element: This element is used to instatiate a bean class in JSP page. 
<jsp:useBean id="" class="" scope="">
4. setPropety and getProperty action element: these elements are used to get and set the values of a property of bean. Generally, used in application based on java beans.
<jsp:getProperty name="nameOfBean" property="propertyName">
<jsp:setProperty name="nameOfBean" property="propertyName" value="ValueOfProperty">
5. plugin action element: This element is used to plugin the applet in the bean. 

Expression Language in JSP
Expression language in JSP actually simplifies the access of object related to session, request, response and other scope.
The syntax of EL is: ${expression}. To simplify the task even furthur, we are given some commonly used object in JSP. So, we do not need to create them overselve but can use directly. Below are the implcit EL object:
pageScope (pageLevelScope), requestScope, sessionScope, applicationScope, param, paramValues, header, headerValues, Cookies, initParam, pageContext. 
There are many operators we can use in Expression language.

ServletInterviewQuestions File
RRR: Source1: 1, 11, 18, 20, 24, Source2: what is servlet config obkect?, 
AAA: Source1: 7: "The only difference between printwriter and ServletOutputStream is that first the char oriented used for creating char or string may be while other is used to create may be byte array." Source2: 2: Idempotent method are those which gives the same result even when called multiple times in a row while non idempotent are those which can have different result when same request is sent again. GET is idempotent while POST is non idempotent. Now, Safe methods are those which do not change the representation state of resource at server side. Do not mix up in idempotent and safe because they loop same.

Question Faced in Interview File

CBSI telephonic interview
1. Two static overloaded methods in which if one method accept argument as string and other accept Object. If null if passed to the method then which implementation will be invoked? String will get invoked because string can be a null. 

2. Question is same as above question, only this is object argument is replaced by Integer. Now if we pass null then what will happen? It will give compilation error as it will be ambiguous to invoke which of the two overloaded methods. 

3. What is the difference in get and load methods in hibernate. 

4. What all is present under jdk folder? When we download java the we get jdk folder which contains jre folder, bin folder and other stuff. Bin of Jdk has got all the executable files like compiler, debugger, documentor, dessembler and other. JRE folder got the bin folder (contains all dll files), classes folder, liscence file, readme file, introduction html file. 

5. What is overhiding? 
When child class writes the same method as a static method in parent class then this is called as overhiding. No error is received. 

6. Difference in get and load method of hibernate? 

7. What was the last code change you have done? File upload for anti virus check. 

8. How to print only unique number from an arrayList with mixed numbers? We can convert the list to set as set contains only unique values. 

9. Printing an string from JSP? We can print string in three ways in JSP which are expression element, out.print() and <c:out value=${some exoression or string}>. 

10. Three columns in a table: id, name and salary. Find out the top salary and name of the employee. "select name max(salary) as Max_salary from employee." and second highest salary as "select max(salary) from employee where salary NOT IN (select max(salary) from employee)".

11. Added another column in the above table department. Asked to get max salary of each department. select name, max(salary) from employee group by department. 

12. What is null pointer exception. How will we create a null pointer exception by changing second line of the below code.
String s = null;
System.out.println(s);
A string created as null or got the default value of null does not throw null pointer exception while it prints the "null". In the above code, if no changes are done then it will print null. Yes, it will print null just like string. Also. if a string is created using new keyword and not given anything then will print nothing but not gives null pointer exception. Only when a string is created by using new keyword and given a reference which is null then it gives null pointer exception. This is because if a reference is null then it isnt pointing to a memory address. Therefore below code will give null pointer exception.
String s;
String s1 = new String(s);
System.out.println(s1);
The best way to handle null pointer exception is to do check if the object we are using is not a null before using it, esp the one that we are getting but we havent created. 

13. What will happen if we override service method is servlet and write one print statement when a request comes? We also have doGet and doPost methods written in the same servlet.
Only the print statement written in overriden service method will be printed and doGet or doPost will not be called. This is because we are not suppose to override the service method of parent class as its implementation is only responsible for calling either Get or Post method according to the request. 

14. If called and calling methods has catch block catching the Exception and exception comes in try block of called mathod then which catch block will catch the exception and what will the flow of the program. 
Catch of child will catch the exception. Also, the code written after the catch of the child will execute giving back the control to the called method. 

15. Where have i used inheritance in code or ever written a classes with inheritance relation?

16. What design patterns have you worked on? Singleton, Factory pattern and MVC. Describe each with a real time example. 

17. Difference in primary and unique key?

18. Complete JaxB working. Explain with code.

19. we have an array with numbers which are repeated. We need to find out the count of each numbers in the array.
public class Class1{
	public static void main(String args []){
		Class1 c = new Class1();
		int[] numbers = {1,2,4,4,5,2,1,3,4,6,3,5,2,5,6};
		c.checkCount(numbers);
	}
	public void checkCount(int[] numbers){
		Map<Integer, Integer> numberCount = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
		for(int i=0;i<numbers.length; i++){
			int count=1;
			for(int j=i+1; j<numbers.length; j++){
				if(numbers[i]==numbers[j]){
					count++;
				}
			}
			if(!(numberCount.keySet().contains(numbers[i]))){
				numberCount.put(numbers[i], count);
			}
		}
		Set set = numberCount.entrySet();
		Iterator<Entry> i = set.iterator();
		while(i.hasNext()){
			System.out.println(i.next());
		}
	}
}


20. Print the reverse of an int number without using String or array.

21. How will you manage transaction in jdbc? How will you manage to commit one query while rollback the other query in jdbc if the exception comes in third query. 
Here we can use savepoint. 

22. Whats the difference between <%@ include file and <jsp:include page="">. First, gets the included resource at the tramslation to servlet time while the other gets it at the request time. 

23. We have two arrays such that the second array has an odd number which is the only missing number in the second array. Example:
a=[1,2,3,4] and b=[1,5,2,3,4]. The odd number is 5.
public class Class1{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Class1 c = new Class1();
		int[] a = {1,2,3,4};
		int[] b = {1,5,2,3,4};
		for(int i=0; i<b.length;i++){
			int flag=0;
			for(int j=0; j<a.length; j++){
				if(b[i]==a[j]){
					flag=1;
				}
			}
			if(flag==0){
				System.out.println(b[i]);
			}
		}
	}
}

24. SQL injection?

25. A table has two columns which are emp_id and projectcode. An employee can be tagged with multiple project or 1 project as well. Write a query to find the count of employees with more than 1 project. 
Example: 
Emp_id and projectCode Columns: (1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (2,a), (2,b) and (3,a). 
An Attempt: Select count(employee) from (Select emp_id as employees, count(emp_id) as emp_id from employee groupby count having count>1))

26. QueryParam annotation in web services. 

27. Volatile Variable and trainsient variable.

28. How will you perform caching and use it before making a call to db? We can use hashmap for caching and store data inside the hashmap. Next time if a call is made to the db we can check that first in the internal cache. 

29. We have two string. Find that if both string are rotation of other string or not?
Example: "hello" and "llohe". This will return true;
public class Class1{
	public static void main(String [] args){
		Class1 c = new Class1();
		String s = "abcd";
		String s1 = "bcda";
		System.out.println(c.isRotationString(s, s1));
	}
	public boolean isRotationString(String s1, String s2){
		char first=s1.charAt(0);
		char next = s1.charAt(1);
		if(s1.length()!=s2.length()){
			return false;
		}else{ 
			for(int i=0; i<s1.length()-1; i++){
				if((s2.charAt(i)==first && s2.charAt(i+1)==next)&& i!=s1.length()-1){
					return true;
				}
			}
			if(s2.charAt(s2.length()-1)==first && s2.charAt(0)==next){
				return true;
			}
		}
		return false;
	}
}

30. Implement your own hashset. Use it using HashMap. 

31. Write a program to sort array containing 0 and 1 without using an API.
public class Class1{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Class1 c = new Class1();
		int[] numbers = {0,1,1,0,1,0};
		int temp=0;
		for(int i=0; i<numbers.length; i++){
			for(int j=i+1; j<numbers.length; j++){
				if(numbers[i]>numbers[j]){
					temp=numbers[i];
					numbers[i]=numbers[j];
					numbers[j]=temp;
				}
			}
		}
		for(int k=0; k<numbers.length;k++){
			System.out.println(numbers[k]);
		}
	}
}

32. If we have employee class and we have three objects e1, e2 and e3 by giving same values to the data member. We tried inserting these tp hashset then what will be the length of hashSet? 
In ordinary situation, duplicate hashset values will be inserted in the hashSet. For avoiding this situation, user defined class needs to implement hashcode() and equals() method.
 public int hashCode(){
        System.out.println("In hashcode");
        int hashcode = 0;
        hashcode = price*20;
        hashcode += item.hashCode();
        return hashcode;
    }
     
    public boolean equals(Object obj){
        System.out.println("In equals");
        if (obj instanceof Price) {
            Price pp = (Price) obj;
            return (pp.item.equals(this.item) && pp.price == this.price);
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
Above is the hashcode and equals method.

33. Can we create a thread by extending Thread class and Runnable interface both. Yes! We can do this. However, we must make sure we extend thread first and then implements runnable interface. The order if reversed will give compilation error. We can create thread in either ways if both thread class and runnable interface is used.

6. HTTP request and response components.
HTTP request must be having the URL and the type of http method used to send the request. Also, it should contain the content type and accept header params in header of request. It can also contain an payload in case of post and put request. Response should contain the status code and resultant output of the request processed. Response should also contains header param like the response type and chache param or any other param, if any. 
7. Statelessness of web services and its advantage. 
Statelessness means that web services does not track any state(data) regarding the different calls made a client and therefore, each client request should contain sufficient data for making server capable of processing request. Restful web service should be stateless so as to be simpler and more scalable. It is a design based decision of REST architecture that is quite aligned with HTTP protocol which is stateless too.  
8. Chaching in web service. How we do it and advantage. 
Caching means storing servers response on the client side so that client do not need to send request for same resource again and again. Cache control header is send in the server resoonse to decide the properties of caching. The hear can be set public or private. If made public then any component can cache it while private make only destination client to cache the response. We can set the max age of the caching. It mean until what time a response can be cached. 
9. Payload. It are the data that we send in a request while request param does not fall in this category. We cannot have payload in GET and DELETE request.  
10. Different application integration styles?
Here, Integeration styles means how different component of an application can be integrated or can interact. This can be done in multiple way which are messaging (example:JMS), batch files, Remote procedure calls and file transfer. 
11. Annatation used when exchanging data in XML. @XMLRootElement, @XMLAttribute, @XMLElement.
12. JAXB purpose in webservice:
Jaxb is used to marshal and unmarshal the java object to xml and vice versa. 
Code for marshalling:
JAXBContext jcontext = JAXBContext.getInstance(Student.class);
Marshaller marshaller = jcontext.createMarshaller();
Marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATED_OUTPUT, true);
Student s = new Strudent(1, “Rishav”);
Marshaller.marshal(s, new FileOutputStream(“path of file”));
Code for Unmarshalling
JAXBContext jcontext = JAXBContext.getInstance(Student.class);
Unmarshaller unmarshaller = jcontext.createUnmarshallar();
File file = new File(“XML data file path”);
Student student = (Student) unmarshalar.unmarshal(file);
13. What HTTP basic authentication in web services and how do we implement it?
HTTP basic authentication is a simple technique of providing authentication on accessing a web resource. For creating the basic autherization param we need to create a string. First create a simple string "username:password", then encode the string through encode Base64 and append the string "Basic " with the previous string. Finally, send the resultant string as a value of Authorization key param in header. On the client side, we can use header param through annotation @headerparam("Authentication") String authString. In servlet technology, we get the header value like "request.getHeader()".
14. How do we configure web service. 
15. WADL: Web application description language which a machine readable xml format document to derscribe the http based web service.

||Before We begin with AngularJS||
AngularJS is an javascript framework. Before we begin with angularJS, lets check why do we even need framework for javascipt? 
Why do we have javascript frameworks like angularjs, amber, reactjs and other at the first place? Well, when we do client side scripting by using raw javascript code then it first uses DOM object to get the element, performs some logic to get the data and finally it modify the element.  This way the code looks messy. Also, the problem that server side developer for really long period about separating the concern is also looks the predominent in client side scripting. Therefore, to write more elegant code with proper separation of concern we should use client side frameworks esp in large enterprise aplications. 

||Intro with AngularJS||
AngularJS is a javascript framework that extends HTML attibute with directives and adds data to HTML views with expressions. AngularJS is a google project and thus most compatible with google chrome browser.

Now, we will see how angularjs solve the above purpose of client side framework. AngularJS is not like jquery which is just a framework of using javascript in a better way. However, it a whole different way to writting client side scripting. The tagline for AngularJS is enhanced HTML for web apps which means the it extends the current fuctionality of HTML. Let check an example to understand what it means to extends a functionality of HTML. 
For showing the current date inside a div tag through javascript we will write code like below:
<div id="dateDiv">
/*show the date here through javascript*/
</div>
<script>
function showDate(){
	writing code to show date;
}
document.getElementById("dateDiv").innerText = showDate();
</script>
In the code above, we are using javascript for getting the element, running the logic and mofifying the HTML. What if HTML element itself had an attribute or an special element that is capable of showing date? Someting like below.
<div currentDate>date shown here</div>
Well, we do not have anything in HTML like this. This is what angularJS does. It extends the element of HTML to create custom tags. Also, this kind of programming is called declarative programming where something is declared once and used multiple times later which is indefferent of javascript which is imperative. We also need to understand that in declarative programming we write imperative programming the first time we create an element. 

Angular has important component to understand which are directives, controller, modules, Expression, Services, filters and other. All these we will cover now.

||Creating an AngularJS application||
We can use visual studio code. For creating AngularJS app we must need to have angular.js file dowloaded. We can do this in couple of way. Firstly, we can download the latest stable version and use it. Second, we can use CDN (content distribution network) which is just link that we can use. We also have minified and uncompressed file. 
I am using visual studio, so i have added a local directory in visual studio where we have stored angular.js. Thus, angular.js file will also we available in visual studio and we are good to start coding in angularJS. Below is first piece of code written which print good morining if hour of the day is less than 12, prints good afternoon if in between 12 to 17, if greater than 12 and less than 20 then good evening while if greater than 20 then prints good night. 

<html ng-app>
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body ng-init="hourOfDay=20">
        <h1>Hello angular!</h1>
        <p ng-if="hourOfDay<12">Good Morning</p>
        <p ng-if="hourOfDay>=12 && hourOfDay<17">Good Afternoon</p>
        <p ng-if="hourOfDay>=17 && hourOfDay<20">Good Evening</p>
        <p ng-if="hourOfDay>=20">Good Night</p>
    </body>
<html>

||Angular Expression||
Angular Expression are nothing but the code written inside the double brackets or ng-bind. Expression may contains literal, variable or/and operators. The expression are evaluated and bind with HTML.
AngularJS variables like number, string, arrays and object as same as we have in javascript. AngularJS expressions does not support looping while support filter which is opposite of jaascript. 

||Angular Modules||
AngularJS Module(s) defines an angular application while also define a part of angular app. Modules serves as a container for controllers, directives, filters and etc. We have a controller() method for adding controller to a particular module. Let check how can we add code to add these entities to a module.
1. Adding controller to a module:
moduleName.controller("controllerName", functionName);. Please note that we do not add () with function name. 
2. Adding custom directives to a module:
module.directive("directiveName", function(){
	//code for defining the directive.
})
3. How to add filter? that we will check later

note:
1. We should avoid having the global function or variables as they are accisable across your app and thus can accidently may get changed. 
2. Generally, javascript file are written in the bottom of body tag but in angular it is recommended to add them in header or start of body. This is because angular.module can only be loaded when libraries are loaded. 

||Angular Directives||
Angular directives are more like the magic by angul;ar to extend the properties of directives to a whole new level. Angular provides many builtin directives that we can use. Lets has a look on some of the most commonly used directives in angular. 
ng-app: This directive shows that the HTML page is an angularJS app and auto bootstrap the angular js appication. It acts as a root element of angular js. It is not necessary to write it in HTML tag. Also, auto bootstrap happens only when we just have one ng-app while for multiple ng-app we need to do manual bootstrap. This you need to write to get started with angular in an HTML page.
ng-init: This is to initialize a variable. But hold on, where have we declard a variable? We do not need to decalre a variable in angularJS. We can simply initialize it. Also, ng-init should not be used as it is not a good angular coding practice. Only place we should use it is inside loops which we will check later. 
ng-if: This is just an if condition. If false is return then the element will not be added while works only re expression returns true. 
ng-controller:
ng-model:
ng-show:
ng-hide:
ng-repeat:

Note:
1. Also, we need to understand that howcome a variable is initalized wtih ng-init can be used in ng-if? The moment a variable associate with an ng directive, it is added to the common space called as scope. Each ng directive under a specific ng-app root tag can access this scope. This way an ng-app has a scope. 

Now, we will look at how can we create our own directive. The sole purpose of directives is to extebnd the properties of HTML. With custom directives, we can extends the properties of HTML the way we want. We can create the custom directive using the directive function of module. Angular provide support to create custom directive as Element Directive, attribute, CSS class and comment. 
Below are steps to create a custom directive:
1. Create a module and use directive() method of module object. Directive() method takes in two arguments, first being the name of your custom attribute and second being the function which will kind of implement the directive features and functionalities. 
2. create a directive object which is empty like "var directive = {}". Then, define different properties of direcrtive object like template, restrict, scope, compile and other. Template will show to replace what HTML of the actual directive in HTML. I meam when we use directive in HTML, then that get replaced during bootstraping time by the HTML written inside the tempalte property of directive object. restrict will define the restrictions like E,A,C or M which stands for Element, Attribute, Class and Comment. Scope is used to distinguesh each directive type through a property. For example: directive.scope:"=name" says the student directive will be identified through name of the studnet. Likewise, there are other properties that we can set. Below is the sample code that shows a simple custom directive:
var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
app.directive("w3TestDirective", function() {
    return {
        restrict : "A",
        template : "<h1>Made by a directive!</h1>"
    };
});

||Angular Model||
Well, the worth studing directive here is ng-model. We have already used in video tutorial. Their we have used it to get the data given by the user in the input field and added to the scope. Then, till data can be used. 
Now, we will see how can we validate user supplied data using ng-model:
<form ng-app="" name="myForm">
    Email:
    <input type="email" name="myAddress" ng-model="text">
    <span ng-show="myForm.myAddress.$error.email">Not a valid e-mail address</span>
</form>
In the above code, input email is given by user that is bound with model text which is then used to validate data. In the span below, we have used ng-show to show the error if validation method returns true. 

||Angular Data Binding||
Here, we just need to understand that ng-bind and {{}} is used to bind data with HTML element. 

||Angular Controller||
Here, we should know that we creating scrioting functionality using controllers which are registered in the modules. We already know how to reguster it. 
Remember we can use the controller in the other file as well until it is part of main module. If the controller is part of other module then we have to use the way we add any external module. 

||Angular Scopes||
We should know that ng-app="moduleName" brings a global scope. When different controllers are regustered in module and $scope is passed as argument then a child scope related to that controller is created. The properties of that controller belongs to the scope of controller. 
We should know the scopes has heirarchy in angular. Outer controller scope comes under global scope that a module gets while the controller inside a controller gets a scope whi

||Angular Filters||
AngularJs provides filter to transform data. For example, angular has currency filter which is used to transform a normal number into currency format. Now, how do we use a filter? We can use a filter inside an expression separating the filter through pipe with the expression. 
A simple piece of code is below:
<div>
            {{10000 | currency}}
</div>
O/P: $10,000
Not onl to expression but we can add filter to directives as well and the syntax is similar. See the example below:
<div ng-repeat="i in array | orderBy:'currency'">
        {{i}}   
</div>

We have alot of built in angular filter which are below:
1. Currency: Formats a numbers like a currency. Adds commas and $ sign.
2. Date: Format a date into specified date format. 
3. filter: filters the subset which matches a char or group of chars from an array.
4. json: Format an object to a JSON string. This is just like marshalling. 
5. lowercase and uppercase
6. number: format number to a string
7. orderBy: it order a for loop iteration of array element based on a particular property of object. 
8. limitTo: limits an array/string into a specified numbers of elements. 

We can also create our own custom filter which can be done just like we create a custom directive. We have filter() method in module object. 

||Angular Services||
Angular has another very important feature called as services. Angular has got around 30 in built services and just like directives and filters we can create our custom services. Let's understand what services are through an example $location. 
var module = angular.module("mymodule", []);
module.controller("ControllerName", functionName);
function functionName($scope, $location){ /*here you can see we are using scope and location services passed as arugment of method*/
	/*some business logic.*/
}
This is more like using some information across multiple controllers. We can relate this as window.location. Also, if anything that is not covered by buikltin services then we can create custom services and use then across different controllers. 
Let's see some commonly used and important services:
1. $http: This service lets your angular app to make a request to server and handle responses. 
note: passing services as arguments in controller is also seens as dependency inject as we declare the dependencies of controller and this have been provided by angular. 
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $http) {
    $http.get("welcome.htm").then(function (response) {
        $scope.myWelcome = response.data;
    });
});
2. $timeout: This service works equivalent to window.setInterval() in javascript. 
3. $interval: This service works equivalent to window.interval() in javascript. 

Data binding
Well, we have another directive ng-bind which helps in binding the variable in the scope of ng-app with the HTML element. Check the example below:
<p> The hour of the day is: <span ng-bind="hourOfDay+1"></span></p>. 
OR
<p> The hour of the day is: <span> {{hourOfDay+1}}</span></p>
This was we can bind the processed data with HTML and display in our web page. Its all possible because all the variables resides in a common space that we call scope. 




note: As we saw two ways of binding the data with HTML in Angular. With ng-bind directive, we had used the span tag and we havnt used ng-bind with paragraph tag because ng-bind values would have replaced all the value present currently in p. However, with curly brackts we can use it directly inside <p>. Thus, coding becomes simplified. Below is the easiest way:
<p> The hour of the day is: {{hourOfDay+1}}</p>

[note continues]We have previously discussed that ng-init is not a good way to get the data and we should not use it. Then, how should we setup data for the view? We have to set up data for the view in controller in angular. 
We will now look at how can we use controller. Angular is also an MVC framework where concerns are separated in the form of modal, view and controller. We will now have to learn the concept of creating controller in AngularJS. We have a directive in Angular called ng-controller through which we can use a controller. Ng-controller is used to call an angular controller which in term is bind with a function before an HTML element to which ng-controller is attached. Have a look at the code below:
<html ng-app="MyappModule">
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div ng-controller="MainCntl">
            <h1>Hello angular!</h1>
            <p ng-if="hourOfDay<12">Good Morning</p>
            <p ng-if="hourOfDay>=12 && hourOfDay<17">Good Afternoon</p>
        </div>
        <script>
            var module = angular.module("MyappModule", []);
            module.controller("MainCntl", Main);
            function Main($scope){
                $scope.hourOfDay=2;
                console.log("Some business logic is performed.");
            }
        </script>
    </body>
<html>
 
Here, we have first created a module which you can consider like a phone book. To create a module, we have used module method of object angular. The object angular is provided by the argular.js file that we have imported in the HTML page. We pass two arguments in module method which are module name and an empty array. We will find out what is second argument is all about. So, we have created a module. Then, we can add controller to that module. This is just like adding a phone number entry in the phone book. So, to add a controller to the module we will use controller method of module object. We need to pass two arguments which are the controller name and function name. So far, we have created a module and added a controller to it. Now, we also need to add the module to ng-app. Check the code above see syntax. Now, the directive ng-controller will work if we call a particular module. 
This way we have removed the ng-init for initializing the hourOfDay variable and using controller for the same. We should also notice that we are using $scope as the controller argument. When a controller is called which will call the function ultimately. Function needs $scope as the argument then who is providing the argument? Ofcourse angular is doing this for us. Then, we can use the same scope to add variable hourOfDay to it and use it as a binding with HTML element. 


Clock App
We have built an app called clock app which prints the current date. This is will cover all the concept of creating module, registering controller to module, adding module to ng-app, using ng-controller, using $scope for registering the variable in angular scope, data will be updated or setup in controller, and is bind using ng-bind or double curly brackets inside the HTML tag. We have also created a button which will refresh the time without reloading the page. To do so we need to have event based action in angular. On the click of the button time should refresh. To do so we need to use another directive called ng-click which is equivalent to onclick attribute of javascript. Now, we ng-click we have to bind a function. Since, we have controller as one function so it cannot call it directly. Thus, we will create a property of controller as a function which is a perfect example where variables are used as function. Actually, I was asked this question in one of the interview and I wasn’t too confident. Check the code below. 
<html ng-app="ClockModule">
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>
            Clock App
        </h1>
        <div ng-controller="ClockController">
            <p>{{timeString}}<p>
            <button ng-click="updateTime()">refresh</button>
        </div>
        <script>
            var module = angular.module("ClockModule", []);
            module.controller("ClockController", clock);
            function clock($scope){
                var currentDate = new Date();
                $scope.timeString = currentDate.toTimeString();
                $scope.updateTime = function(){
                    var currentDate = new Date();
                    $scope.timeString = currentDate.toTimeString();
                }
            }
        </script>
    </body>   
<html>

Two Way Binding
We have so far seen one way binding where the data is setup in the controller and either through ng-bind or double curly bracket and is presented in the HTML page. This happens as the data setup in the controller is added to the scope of angular and then utilized in HTML page. But how about anything that is provided as the input of HTML page and is added to the scope and there on can we used anywhere. This is called two ways binding. Below is the code which is quite self-explanatory. 
<html ng-app>
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <input type ="text" ng-model="textfield"></input>
        <input type="checkbox" ng-model="checkbox"></input>
        <input type="date" ng-model="datefield"></input>
        <input type="radio" ng-model="radiofield" value="opt1"></input>
        <input type="radio" ng-model="radiofield" value="opt2"></input>
        <input type="radio" ng-model="radiofield" value="opt3"></input>

        <p>{{textfield}}</p>
        <p>{{checkbox}}</p>
        <p>{{datefield}}</p>
        <p>{{radiofield}}</p>
        <script>
           
        </script>
    </body>   
<html>

Note: one important thing to mention. If we give ng-model value of one input field to other than the change of the original input field will be reflected in other input field too because the field gets changed then the values of it is updated in the scope at that very moment. So, the same updated value gets reflected in the other input field at the same moment. 
 
Nested Controller and scope heirarchy
We can also have controller inside a controller which has some problems to tackled. When we have multiple controller which are not nested then we can use them in individual div elements and everything works the same way we were working with just one controller. However, we need to be careful when we nest the controller like below. 
<html ng-app="TestModule">
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div ng-controller="cntl1">
            <p>{{test}}</p>
            <div ng-controller="cntl2">
                <p>{{test}}</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <script>
           var module = angular.module("TestModule", []);
           module.controller("cntl1", cntl1);
           module.controller("cntl2", cntl2);
           function cntl1($scope){
                $scope.test="from cntl 1";
           }
           function cntl2($scope){
                //$scope.test="from cntl 2";
           }
        </script>
    </body>   
<html>

In the above code, we have created two controllers then we are using second controller with div which is nested in other div where first controller is used. we have a variable with the same name in both the controller. Notice that we get scope injected in the controller functions by angular. The scope object injected for a controller is different than the other controller. So, we now have variable with the same name in scope of both the controller. In the nested divs, if we try to use that variables then the variables of correct scope only get utilitzed and everything is fine until now. Assume we have now remove the variable from the inner controller then it should not use the variable since we just removed it. But, the variable with the same name in the outer controller gets used. This is because when we nest the controller then their scopes creates an heirarchy. If a vairbles is not found in main scope of the target controller then the same variable name is looked up in parent scope until it reaches root scope. This way the variables of parent scope get used even though we have removed the variable from child scope for some reason. This is a problem and we need to oversome this.

The solution to the above described problem is very simple. We need to use controller as syntax which provides an alias to a controller and whenever we want to refer any property from the controller we should call it using the alias. So, it makes thing clear that which controller scope to use and if the property is not found then it does not look up. check the code below to see how actually we can do this. 
<html ng-app="TestModule">
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div ng-controller="cntl1 as c1">
            <p>{{c1.test}}</p>
            <div ng-controller="cntl2 as c2">
                <p>{{c2.test}}</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <script>
           var module = angular.module("TestModule", []);
           module.controller("cntl1", cntl1);
           module.controller("cntl2", cntl2);
           function cntl1(){
                this.test="from cntl 1";
           }
           function cntl2(){
                //this.test="from cntl 2";
           }
        </script>
    </body>   
<html>

As you can see, we have used as and given an alias just next to ng-controller directive. We also have to mention the alias which using that controller. On the script side, we need to remove the scope object that we were writting as the argument because when we use as syntax then we have to use this keyword. Using this keyword we need to write the properties. This change is obviously govern and taken care by angular and we can assume a this keyword value is as the current scope whenever the controller is called. 
Note: 
1. Lastly, when we do not use as syntax then we have to use $scope object as argument. 
2. Some advantage of using as syntax is that it obviously removing the change of getting the wrong value from parent scopes. Secondly, it is quite flexible since we can specify the value from any pther scope if we actually need it by specifying the alias of different controller. 

Calculartor App
Let create an app which can calculate basic operations like addition, substraction, multiplication and division. Below is the source code:
app.js
var module = angular.module("calcModule", []);
module.controller("calcController", calcfunction);
function calcfunction(){
    this.calc = function(action){
        this.selectedOperation=action;
    }
    this.compute = function(){
        var opr1 = parseFloat(this.op1);
        var opr2 = parseFloat(this.op2);
        if(this.selectedOperation==='+'){
            this.result = opr1 + opr2;
        }
        if(this.selectedOperation==='-'){
            this.result = opr1 - opr2;
        }
        if(this.selectedOperation==='*'){
            this.result = opr1 * opr2;
        }
        if(this.selectedOperation==='/'){
            this.result = opr1 / opr2;

index.html
<html ng-app="calcModule">
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        </body>
        <div ng-controller="calcController as cntl">
            <h1>Calculator App</h1>
            <input name="text1" ng-model="cntl.op1"></input>
            <p>{{cntl.selectedOperation}}</p>
            <input name="text2" ng-model="cntl.op2"></input>
            <p><button ng-click="cntl.compute()">=</button><p>
            <p>result: {{cntl.result}}</p>

                <button ng-click="cntl.calc('+')" ng-model="action">+</button>
                <button ng-click="cntl.calc('-')" ng-model="action">-</button>
                <button ng-click="cntl.calc('*')" ng-model="action">*</button>
                <button ng-click="cntl.calc('/')" ng-model="action">/</button>  
        </div>
    </body>   
<html>

Note: We could have done the same using controller as syntax as well.

Ng-show and ng-hide Directives
Its time to see how can we show something HTML element based on boolean value. Well, previosly we have seen ng-if which based on what a consition return will show an element. Well, we have some other directives so doing the same which are ng-show and nh-hide. If ng-show gets boolean true then it shows the element while hides when it gets false. ng-hide is opposite of ng-show. Check the example below.
<html ng-app="calcModule">
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        </body>
        <div ng-controller="calcController">
            <input type="checkbox" ng-model="checkbox"></input>
            <p ng-show="checkbox">Some text</p>
        </div>
    </body>   
<html>

Now, since we already have ng-if then why should we use ng-show and nh-hide? There is a difference in ng-if and ng-show/hide. If we use ng-if and it gets false then it permanently removes the HTML element while ng-show just adds a angular based css class that simply hides the element. Check more on source tab in dev console.

Ng-repeat
Now, its time to see how can we perform looping an angular. For this we have another directive called as ng-repeat. If we have an array then we can use ng-repeat just like we have used below to get the iterate through the values of array. Check the example below. 

var module = angular.module("repeatModule", []);
module.controller("repeatController", repeatCont);
function repeatCont($scope){
    /*Array of objects*/ 
    $scope.array = [
        {'name':"Rishav", 'age':'25'},
        {'name':"Mishra", 'age':'26'}
    ];
}

<html ng-app="repeatModule">
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div ng-controller="repeatController">
        <div ng-repeat="i in array">
                <p>name: {{i.name}} and age: {{i.age}}</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>   
<html>

Now, as you can notice we are using syntax like "i in arrayName". Here, i gets the value of elements of array. If the elements are object then we can use the properties like i.property.

Ng-repeat scope
So far we have seen that ng-repat directive is used to create looping. We will now understand the scopes in ng-repeat. We have seen ng-controller having scopes. Similarly, we have ng-repeat which has scopes. For each iteration of ng-repeat a new scope is created. Right now its little confusing as to why do we have it. The justification i can offer is since i in array, i has different copy of value which are the values of array. We need to understand the each copy of i exist concurrently thus needs scope for each value. 
We also get some default variables which are the part of scope that gets created in ng-app and these variables are $index which gets the index for the loop (just like counter), $first return true if its first element and likewise we also have $mid, $last, $even and $odd.

Angular Module
Now, as the complexity in growing in enterprise application, single module may not suffice. Therefore, we may have multiple modules. HOw can we have multiple modules in angular application. Beloware the steps and a sample code for having multiple module.
Steps:
1. Create a separate js file constaining the new module and controllers registered. 2. Add the new module in the module empty array which is registered with ng-app. 
3. add the new module js file as a script in the HTML page. 
4. use the controller of new module the same way we use main module. 

Code:
myModule.js
var myModule = angular.module("myModule", []);
myModule.controller("myController", myController);
function myController(){
    this.a="Rishav";
}

app.js
var module = angular.module("repeatModule", ["myModule"]);
module.controller("repeatController", repeatCont);
function repeatCont($scope){
    /*Array of objects*/ 
    $scope.array = [
        {'name':"Rishav", 'age':'25'},
        {'name':"Mishra", 'age':'26'}
    ];
}

index.html
<html ng-app="repeatModule">
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
        <script src="myModule.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div ng-controller="myController as mycntl">
            <p>{{mycntl.a}}</p>
        </div>
    </body>   
<html>

Note: check many modules available in ngmodule.org. To use any external module from this source the procedure is same. Try some time.
